# Django-first-project

## My first python project with Django

### Welcome to my first Python 3 project using Django

This is a simple shop application using Django

### In this project I have learnt:

##### How to install Django and create a new project, create a new application package inside the project

##### How to create classes to hold data (previously learnt JavaScript where classes are mainly replaced by functions and hooks)

##### How to write Python according to PEP8 standards.

##### How to use sqlite3 and sqlitebrowser.

##### How to output things using Django dynamically.

##### Using Bootstrap.

## To run my simple site

Please just fork and clone into your own source code editor of choice, run installs to get any dependencies, then open on your own machine using localhost:8000/products to view the final page.
